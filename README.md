Nanoshield_LoadCell
===================

This is our Arduino library to measure weight using load cells with the ADS1230 IC from Texas Instruments.

The reference board to use this library is the [LoadCell Nanoshield](https://www.circuitar.com.br/en/nanoshields/modules/loadcell/) from Circuitar.

To install, just copy it under &lt;Arduino sketch folder&gt;/libraries/

The following examples are provided:

* **ReadWeight** shows how to do a simple weight measurement using a load cell.
* **MultiWeight** shows how to read more than one weight using multiple load cells.
