Nanoshield_LoadCell
===================

This is our Arduino library to measure weight using load cells with the ADS1230 IC from Texas Instruments.

The reference board to use this library is the [LoadCell Nanoshield](https://www.circuitar.com.br/en/nanoshields/modules/loadcell/) from Circuitar.

To install, just copy it under &lt;Arduino sketch folder&gt;/libraries/
